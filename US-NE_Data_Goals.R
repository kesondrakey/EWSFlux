#Graph: plot max ET and max Rn on a daily scale then see what time the max occurs and how they interact with each other

#goal: plot ET and VPD hourly data during drought years
#Step 1: determine drought years by plotting annual total precipitation at each site (should be 2010 and 2012)
#Step 1A: determine drought months by plotting monthly total precipitation at each site
#Step 1B: determine drought dyas by plotting daily total precipitation at each site; if this is unhelpful; try daily temperature then select max temp
#Step 2: Calculate hourly ET and VPD at each site
#Step 3: Plot hourly ET and VPD
#Step 4: Plot daily max ET and Rn; see what time this occurs; how do they interact with each other?
